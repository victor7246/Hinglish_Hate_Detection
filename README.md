### Ideas for the work

 - [x] Transformer for classification
 - [x] Effectiveness of transfer learning from one dataset to another
 - [x] Pseudo labelling for multi-task learning
 - [x] Causal interpretation of model to interpret contribution of individual tokens to the final target
 - [x] Attribution of each token to hate, sarcasm, irony, humor
