### Ideas for the work

 - [ ] Transformer for classification
 
 - [ ] Effectiveness of transfer learning from one dataset to another
 
 - [ ] Pseudo labelling for multi-task learning
 
 - [ ] Causal interpretation of model to interpret contribution of individual tokens to the final target
 
 - [ ] Attribution of each token to hate, sarcasm, irony, humor
